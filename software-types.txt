Software can be categorized into system software, application software, and development tools.
System software manages hardware, while application software helps users perform tasks.


Web applications run through a web browser and do not require installation on a local device.
They rely on client–server architecture and are commonly built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Because they run online, web applications can be updated and maintained easily.
Many modern services, from banking tools to social media platforms, are delivered as web apps.
