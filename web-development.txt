Web Development Basics:
Web development involves building websites and web applications. 
It consists of multiple parts that work together to deliver functionality and user experience.

Frontend Development:
Frontend refers to the part of a website or application that users interact with directly. 
It includes the layout, design, and interactive elements. 
Common frontend technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Frontend developers focus on user experience and responsiveness.

Backend Development:
Backend is the server-side part of a web application that handles logic, databases, and server communication. 
It ensures that the frontend receives the correct data and functionality. 
Common backend technologies include Python, Node.js, Java, and PHP. 
Backend developers focus on performance, security, and scalability.

Databases:
Databases store and organize the data used by web applications. 
They can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational (like MongoDB). 
Databases allow efficient retrieval, update, and management of data. 
Backend systems communicate with databases to provide information to the frontend.
